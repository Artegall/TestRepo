Our best thoughts came from others. 
-Letters and Social Aims. Quotation and Originality. Ralph Waldo Emerson, ca. 1820-1840s

Sometimes.
- Michael Brown

To be or not to be, that is the question.  
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind 
To withstand the slings and arrows
Of outrageous fortune or to oppose them
And by opposing end them.

- Hamlet, William Shakespeare
